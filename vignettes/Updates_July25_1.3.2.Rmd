# Patch Updates:

## Fixed Labelling Errors

-   Updated labelling of surface temperature, salinity, and chla metadata values by adding "surf\_" prefix (eg. `temp_c` becomes `surf_temp_c`). This will help delineate which values are coming from where for data such as ctd datasheets that record surface temperature and a profiling temperature. *This may cause incompatibilities with previous cruises.* You may see errors that say `"surf_temp_c" not found.` To fix labelling incompatibilities, be sure to run the entire process_data script with the new package version (1.3.2).
-   This patch will hopefully fix an error with the ODV file SeaProcess creates where the surface chla value was incorrectly input as the profiling chla values.

## Updated `process_eoc` Function

-   Updated the required arguments for the `process_eoc` function so marine techs can delete arguments they don't need--like ros files during a cruise that didn't use the carousel.

## Expanded Warnings
-   Added two warnings when creating a cruise project that will alert users when there is already a raw folder or output folder created.
-   Suppressed a warning in ctd processing that salinity was calculated using temperature and conductivity and pressure from oce. 

## Incorporated `format_csv_output` for Sig figs
-   Discovered a labelling inconsistency that was bypassing a function that edited metadata to a desired number of decimal places. Fixing the labelling so now lat, lon, temp, sal, chla, depth will all round to a specific number of decimal places. This number can be updated by changing arguments for `format_csv_output`.
